# Simon Game!
This is a simple Simon Says style game written with HTML/CSS/JavaScript 
that was part of a tutorial from Angela Yu's web development course!

## How To Play
Navigate to https://riccardt.github.io/simon-game/ and follow the onscreen
instructions!
 
I am adding it here because I wrote the game logic myself and I'm really
quite proud of it :)

## Things I Learned
- jQuery Syntax
	Even though jQuery is not used very often ever since ES6 came out,
	I think it's useful to know it since alot of integration testing
	libraries like Cypress still use it for DOM selection.
- Persistent Game Logic Using AJAX
	Instead of using something more standard like a while loop
	for implementing game logic, I used asyncronous event listening
	to flow through the logic of the game. It was interesting to do this, 
	as I had to be very careful as to what element had what function
	tied to it :) Overall, a cool lil project.
